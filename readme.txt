Easily process product price match requests from your customers.

== Description ==

The Price Match for WooCommerce plugin makes it easy to implement and administer a price guarantee in your WooCommerce store! If a customer finds a lower price for a product at a competitor, they can submit a price match request via a form on the product page, and you can choose whether to approve or deny each request by clicking the appropriate link in the notification email or in the WordPress admin. If a request is approved, the customer receives a one-time-use link that allows them to purchase the product at the approved price - no need to manually discount their order!
